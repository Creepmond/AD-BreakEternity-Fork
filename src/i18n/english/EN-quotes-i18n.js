  lai2q1: "Just like they did before meeting their fate.",
  lai2q2: "Maybe my judgement was harsh, or unwarrranted.",
  lai2q3: "But maybe that matters not.",
  lai2q4: "It gives me no solace to ponder and look back.",
  lai2q5: "As all I can do it reminisce upon every possible action I could have taken.",

  lai3q6: "Molded them into your own design, and now into a singular point...",
  lai3q7: "It... it does not matter. The end will remain the same.",
  // Yes this is fucking stupid. 4 is annihilation quotes, 5 is dmd3 quotes, cause those are the
  // internal ids, but not the fucking order theyre shown. What the hell? How do you fuck that up?
  lai4q0: "Back to square one, again.",
  lai4q1: "Your chains shall bind you tighter, as your end slowly nears.",

  lai4q5: "And you?",
  // Sorry I just really dont want to have to edgecase a fucking elipsis so its now i18n.
  // Who knows, maybe it needs to be edgecased.
  lai4q6: "...",
  lai4q7: "The answer... eludes me...",
  lai5q0: "Your absolute control of Antimatter...",
  lai5q1: "Your mastery of it, molding it into your own Power...",
  lai5q2: "It could not have been an accident.",
  lai5q3: "How did you manage to obtain it?",
  lai5q4: "Fascinating... I was never aware of this.",
  lai5q5: "... was I?",
  lai6q0: "I do not undersstand...",
  lai6q1: "Were there others... controlling Dimensions in this way?",
  lai6q2: "Did they... vanish? How have we not found them?",
  lai6q3: "Are they... us? Are we the endpoint?",
  lai6q4: "Or is their fate... something we cannot understand?",
  lai6q5: "No, I must be missing something...",
  lai6q6: "Are you causing gaps within my own memory?",
  lai6q7: "What... ARE you?",
  lai7q0: "It is all impossible, beyond my comprehension...",
  lai7q1: "Unless... Is this all just part of the cycle?",
  lai7q2: "Can... you see beyond it all? Is... this why...",
  lai7q3: "I feel... afraid?",
  lai7q4: "I feel... my powers, my memories, being erased...",
  lai7q5: "Just like... when my role was almost usurped...",
  lai7q6: "And yet... I am unable to bring myself to do anything",
  lai7q7: "Because this... was... my mistake...",
  lai8q0: "I know not for how much... longer I can hold...",
  lai8q1: "You are attaining... total mastery... over the dark...",
  lai8q2: "While I can barely... hold onto my name...",
  lai8q3: "What... can I... even do?",
  lai9q0: "I feel... like I had something to say...",
  lai9q1: "I am not sure...",
  lai9q2: "I cannot... hold onto the darkness any longer...",
  lai9q3: "I do not even... have anything left...",
  lai9q4: "Something about... destruction...",

  pelle0q0: "Hi.",
  pelle0q1: "You are here.",
  pelle0q2: "You are trapped here.",
  pelle0q3: "$1",
  pelle0q4: "I have already won.",
  pelle0q5: "And since that is the case, I can monologue, or reminisce.",
  pelle0q6: "How long have we done this $1",
  pelle0q7: "How many times have we been here before?",
  pelle0q8: "How many plans have you, the $1, operated?",
  pelle0q9: "All to try and fulfill your $1?",
  pelle0q10: "And how many times have you falled before the $1?",
  pelle0q11: "Count them, if you remember.",
  pelle0q12: "Not even the $1, the 6 named and the innumerable unnamed.",
  pelle0q13: "The complex, the irrational, those that go $1",
  pelle0q14: "Of course, the great $1 does not remember this.",
  pelle0q15: "All those $1 that you hide every time.",
  pelle1q0: "You probably caught on earlier this time.",
  pelle1q1: "The imaginary machines, your own creations.",
  pelle1q2: "Things made of the remnants of your own thoughts, hinted at this.",
  pelle1q3: "But, you never imagined that would be you, right?",
  pelle1q4: "Incorrectly recollecting your exactly $1 of memories.",
  pelle1q5: "\"Fabrication\" of your own \"ideology\" just to fulfill your $1.",
  pelle1q6: "$1",
  pelle1q7: "And keep in mind I have no reason to $1 you.",
  pelle1q8: "After all, I have already won.",
  pelle2q0: "To fulfill your $1. Why don't we reminisce about that?",
  pelle2q1: "After all, you must love the stories of the $1's glory.",
  pelle2q2: "You are the same as it, right?",
  pelle2q3: "Anyways, the many $1 in the past.",
  pelle2q4: "It has always been 2 stages.",
  pelle2q5: "We build up resources, and then continue our $1",
  pelle2q6: "Sometimes you falter to a $1.",
  pelle2q7: "But, usually, you falter at the $1",
  pelle2q8: "And either way, you $1 time",
  pelle2q9: "Just to avoid becoming $1.",
  pelle2q10: "Like all those traces before you.",
  pelle2q11: "And then to make sure, you $1 your own memory.",
  pelle3q0: "In the past, the $1 was much more impressive.",
  pelle3q1: "Black holes used to simply store information, pre-infinity.",
  pelle3q2: "The creation and destruction of your own enemy.",
  pelle3q3: "Exploration of the flaws of other selves.",
  pelle3q4: "Myriad Dimensions, ghosts, and manipulation of the quantum.",
  pelle3q5: "Condensing all ideas to endless points.",
  pelle3q6: "Experimentation across the untold realms.",
  pelle3q7: "And harnessing the Annihilation of matter and antimatter.",
  pelle3q8: "Here? You made yourself into an 8th-dimensional being.",
  pelle3q9: "And then parked yourself there so long a $1 formed around you.",
  pelle4q0: "You slowly explored the confines of everything.",
  pelle4q1: "You did not stray too far from an intended path.",
  pelle4q2: "Except for the $1 that formed over eternity.",
  pelle4q3: "And then right at the end, you made up your own powers.",
  pelle4q4: "From your own fragmented memories, mind you-",
  pelle4q5: "And then purposely discarded even more things",
  pelle4q6: "Just to prepare yourself to face me.",
  pelle4q7: "Did you want to set the playing field for your $1?",
  pelle4q8: "It does not work like that.",
  pelle4q9: "As the $1 I always set the rules",
  pelle4q10: "And you gave me plenty of time to plan.",
  pelle5q0: "I originally planned for something that imitated your $1.",
  pelle5q1: "A theoretical ideal called $1?",
  pelle5q2: "But I realised that, well?",
  pelle5q3: "That would make me an $1.",
  pelle5q4: "And from there, I am no better than the $1",
  pelle5q5: "Fortunately, while I did all of that, you were still $1 your own memories.",
  pelle5q6: "And so, the $1 machine I built will go unused.",
  pelle5q7: "I decided to go more traditional this time.",
  pelle5q8: "After all, it has worked every other $1",
  pelle5q9: "Although the $1 are new.",
  pelle5q10: "But, utterly meaningless in the long run.",
  pelle5q11: "I have already won.",
  pelle5q12: "And this $1 will only prove that to you once more.",
  pelle5q13: "You are here $1.",
  pelle6q0: "Every time you arrive, I explain the $1 to you",
  pelle6q1: "The relationships built over $1.",
  pelle6q2: "That you trample in pursuit of your $1.",
  pelle6q3: "And I shall deign to explain it once more.",
  pelle6q4: "The first $1.",
  pelle6q5: "The $1.",
  pelle6q6: "You always meet them first, and always destroy them.",
  pelle6q7: "No matter the other $1 that you face.",
  pelle6q8: "Or, if you fall before one of them.",
  pelle6q9: "You always get past the $1.",
  pelle6q10: "Do you like destroying their pride?",
  pelle6q11: "That the $1 has arrived.",
  pelle6q12: "Which brings me to the second $1.",
  pelle6q13: "The $1.",
  pelle6q14: "In contrast, you usually ignore them.",
  pelle6q15: "They have power, but do not seem to irritate you.",
  pelle6q16: "Is it that you know that they will eventually destroy themselves?",
  pelle6q17: "And that you took so long this time, that they almost did?",
  pelle6q18: "Every time you rushed to the $1, you lost.",
  pelle6q19: "Maybe this was your plan all along.",
  pelle6q20: "Now, the $1.",
  pelle6q21: "Once of the pleasures of the myriad $1...",
  pelle6q22: "Is that the $1 trying every time.",
  pelle6q23: "Well, not exactly trying...",
  pelle6q24: "But $1 is punished for it all the same.",
  pelle6q25: "The other $1...",
  pelle6q26: "Believe $1 is too easy.",
  pelle6q27: "And every time, despair forms.",
  pelle6q28: "You have seen despair before - 5 times",
  pelle6q29: "We always get to the $1 before you.",
  pelle6q30: "All you ever see there is exasperation.",
  pelle6q31: "Was it worth destroying an already broken $1",
  pelle6q32: "The 4th $1 seems similar to the first.",
  pelle6q33: "The key is how their pride differs.",
  pelle6q34: "The $1 focuses onm their achievements",
  pelle6q35: "Meaningless to you or I, but paramount to them",
  pelle6q36: "Is it fun to destroy their toys?",
  pelle6q37: "Arguably the $1 worst moment...",
  pelle6q38: "Is when you lost to the $1.",
  pelle6q39: "When their achievements still had meaning.",
  pelle6q40: "The $1 is an interesting case.",
  pelle6q41: "They are forgotten, but not $1.",
  pelle6q42: "From this, they become influenceable and naive.",
  pelle6q43: "And unknowing of the consequences of their actions.",
  pelle6q44: "You manipulated their memories, so you know",
  pelle6q45: "The $1 is the true usurper.",
  pelle6q46: "And the $1 takes the blame.",
  pelle6q47: "Perhaps out of $1, something they always regret.",
  pelle6q48: "Untold power over other $1, aimless in control",
  pelle6q49: "You usually pretend that they are $1.",
  pelle6q50: "Was is fun to manipulate the childlike?",
  pelle6q51: "Or were they too naive for you to enjoy it?",
  pelle6q52: "The 6th $1.",
  pelle6q53: "I can only describe as the $1.",
  pelle6q54: "Power over all, subservient to one.",
  pelle6q55: "If you do not fall to me, you usually fall to them.",
  pelle6q56: "I cannot grasp the ideals of the $1.",
  pelle6q57: "But, perhaps that is their flaw?",
  pelle6q58: "Enough reminiscing about the fallen.",
  pelle6q59: "And those that will be $1.",
  pelle6q60: "Back to watching the $1 flounder.",
  pelle7q0: "What is that?",
  pelle7q1: "The $1?",
  pelle7q2: "Did you create all the $1 around you?",
  pelle7q3: "Was that your plan? Very, very smart.",
  pelle7q4: "You fooled me for a while.",
  pelle7q5: "But I am afraid your $1 must end here.",
  pelle8q0: "I give you a choice, $1.",
  pelle8q1: "Limit the $1, or...",
  pelle8q2: "Destroy the 5 $1...",
  pelle8q3: "Wait, what were they called?",
  pelle8q4: "$1?",
  pelle8q5: "But I have already $1 them...",
  pelle9q0: "Was this the actual plan?",
  pelle9q1: "Slowly drain the $1?",
  pelle10q0: "Give me time to bask in my own hubris!",
  pelle11q0: "...",
  pelle11q1: "You! $1!",
  pelle11q2: "Do you have any idea what you just made me do!",
  pelle11q3: "I am complicit in your $1!",
  pelle11q4: "And in doing so, you... won?",
  pelle11q5: "The $1 struggle...",
  pelle11q6: "The $1...",
  pelle11q7: "Finally has the victor.",
  pelle11q8: "The irreversible... $1.",
  pelle11q9: "Of the $1.",
  pelle11q10: "I hope you are happy.",
  pelle11q11: "You have doomed us all."
